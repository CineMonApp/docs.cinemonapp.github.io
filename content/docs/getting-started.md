# Getting Started with CineMon

Welcome!
In the next few minutes you’ll turn an iPad, iPhone, or Mac into a fully featured cinema monitor complete with scopes and exposure tools. This guide walks you through **installation**, **hardware setup**, and **first-run orientation** so you can begin shooting with confidence.

---

## 1. System Requirements

| Device | Minimum OS | Recommended |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **iPad / iPhone** | iPadOS / iOS 16.0 | iPad Pro M-series or iPhone 15 Pro for 4K60 passthrough |
| **Mac** | macOS 13 (Ventura) | Apple Silicon Mac for lowest latency |

A USB-C port is required on iPad for UVC capture. Macs can use USB-C **or** Thunderbolt.

---

## 2. Installing CineMon

1. **iPad / iPhone**
   *Open the App Store ➜ search “CineMon” ➜ tap **Get** ➜ wait for the download to finish.*

2. **Mac**
   *Download the signed `.dmg` from <https://www.cinemon.app/download> ➜ drag the CineMon icon into **Applications** ➜ launch once to clear Gatekeeper.*

## 3. Choosing a Capture Interface

Most modern cameras output HDMI (and some SDI). CineMon receives these signals via **UVC-class** devices—the same plug-and-play protocol webcams use.

| Capture Brand | Model Example | Inputs | Max Signal Tested |
|---------------|---------------|--------|-------------------|
| Blackmagic | UltraStudio Recorder 3G | 3G-SDI, HDMI | 1080p60 |
| Elgato | CamLink 4K | HDMI | 4K30 |
| Atomos | Connect 2 | HDMI | 4K30 |
| StarTech | USB3HDCAP | HDMI, Component | 1080p60 |

> **Tip:** If the device works in QuickTime Player’s “New Movie Recording,” it works in CineMon.

## 4. Cable & Power Checklist

* **Short, certified USB-C** cables minimise signal drops.
* Use the **original power adapter** for hungry capture sticks (CamLink 4K draws ~5 W).
* On location, a small **USB-C PD power bank** keeps iPad + capture interface alive for hours.

---

## 5. First Launch & Input Selection

1. **Connect the capture interface** to your iPad or Mac *before* opening CineMon.
2. **Plug your camera’s HDMI/SDI** into the capture interface and set the camera’s output to a supported resolution (1080p59.94 is universally safe).
3. **Launch CineMon**. Within two seconds you should see live video. If you don’t, check:
   * Camera output format matches interface limits.
   * USB-C cable is firmly seated.
   * macOS: open **CineMon ▸ Preferences ▸ Input** and pick the interface from the list.

## 6. A Two-Minute Tour of the UI

1. **Video-Assist Toolbar** (bottom on iPad, side on Mac) — houses toggle buttons for every tool and scope.
2. **Slide-Out Drawers** — drag any toolbar icon upward; a settings drawer “snaps” under your finger. Drag down to hide.
3. **Preset Carousel** — swipe left/right on the picture to cycle built-in presets (“Clean Feed,” “Show LUT,” “Scopes”).
4. **Scopes Bar** (right edge) — enables Histogram, Waveform, Vectorscope, or Quad View.
5. **Gesture Essentials**
   * *Double-tap* anywhere ➜ hide/show toolbars.
   * *Pinch-zoom & drag* ➜ inspect pixel-level focus; a mini-map appears top-left.
   * *Long-press* an icon ➜ duplicate or export the current configuration preset.

## 7. Creating Your First Preset

1. Enable **Grid Overlay** and set it to **3×3**.
2. Turn on **False Color** and choose the “CineMon Default” gradient.
3. Load your camera manufacturer’s **Technical LUT** into Slot 1.
4. Tap **Sidebar ▸ Organizer ▸ + Preset** ➜ name it *“Day-EXT-Tech”*.
5. Swipe left on the picture ➜ CineMon loads *“Clean Feed.”* Swipe right to return — voilà, your first preset is now one gesture away.

---

## 8. Next Steps

* Dive into the **Tools** section to master overlays like Focus Peaking and Zebras.
* Open the **Scopes** section to learn when to rely on Waveform vs Histogram.
* Visit **Presets & Organizer** to share your look with the rest of the camera department.

If you hit snags, the **Troubleshooting** page (coming soon) lists common capture, battery, and frame-rate issues.

## Documentation Conventions

The CineMon documentation includes screenshots throughout. All screenshots are taken with an 11 inch iPad Pro, unless it is necessary to illustrate platform specific differences. Your screen might not match the screenshots exactly.

In a few cases the CineMon interface differs slighltly between the iPad and Mac versions. When it is necessary to distinguish between the two, an {{< ipad >}} or {{< mac >}} colored label will be used to mark the difference.

Advanced features that require an in-app puchase will be marked with a {{< pro-pill >}} label.

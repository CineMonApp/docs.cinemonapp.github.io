## 1  Overview / Purpose & Usage
Touch gestures on iPad and keyboard shortcuts on Mac are the fastest way to navigate CineMon once muscle memory sets in.  Double‑tapping anywhere hides the toolbars so the frame stands alone, pinch‑zoom inspects pixel‑level focus, and swiping left or right cycles though configuration presets like riffles in a card deck.

## 2  Options & Modes
Gestures are hard‑wired; however, **Settings › UI Brightness** influences how stark the hidden toolbars appear when toggled back on.  On Mac, arrow keys perform the same preset cycling, and the Spacebar toggles toolbars—ideal for operators wearing gloves.

## 3  Tips, Best Practices & Use‑Cases
Pinch‑zoom then drag the mini‑map to another quadrant—an unbeatable way to check edge focus on anamorphic cinema lenses without interrupting the take.  During client reviews, double‑tap to hide toolbars, grab a clean screenshot, and send the PNG knowing no UI needs cropping in Photoshop.

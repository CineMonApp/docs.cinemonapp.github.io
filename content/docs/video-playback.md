## Overview

Besides live video monitoring, CineMon also plays back recorded media files. All monitoring functions work exactly the same in playback mode.

## Transport Controls

Media transport controls automatically appear on the **Status Toolbar** when playing back recorded media. These include forward/backward shuttling (1×/2×/4×/8×), Play/Pause, and a progress bar.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

On {{< mac >}} (and {{< ipad >}} OS 26+) the following keyboard shortcuts are available:

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Space` | Play/Pause playback |
| `J` | Increase backward shuttle speed (1×/2×/4×/8×) |
| `K` | Pause playback |
| `L` | Increase forward shuttle speed (1×/2×/4×/8×) |

## Recent Files List

CineMon can keep a list of recently accessed files for convenient access. You can configure how many items CineMon saves in the [**App Settings**](/docs/app-settings) screen.

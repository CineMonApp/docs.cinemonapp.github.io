## 1  Overview / Purpose & Usage
Configuration Presets turn hours of setup into one swipe.  Each preset stores which tools are active, their drawer values, LUT slots, and scope positions.  Open **Sidebar › Organizer** and you land on the Presets tab where you can create, duplicate, rename, export, or drag‑reorder.

## 2  Options & Modes
| Item | Actions | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Preset Cell | Tap to load | Name turns orange when current settings diverge. |
| Long‑press | Duplicate, Rename, Export, Delete | Export creates a `.cmonpreset` bundle for AirDrop. |
| Drag Handle | Re‑order | Organise by scene number or camera letter. |

Two additional tabs hold **Display LUTs** and **False‑Color Gradients**.  LUTs accept `.cube`; gradients import/export as JSON.  Both lists use iOS swipe gestures to rename or delete assets.

## 3  Tips, Best Practices & Use‑Cases
Many crews name presets “Day‑EXT‑Tech,” “Day‑EXT‑Look,” “Night‑INT,” then swipe between them on scout days.  Because export bundles include thumbnail previews, DITs back at basecamp can eyeball which version to apply on review stations.  Remember: if a preset name goes orange, you have unsaved tweaks—tap Save to lock them in or Reset to revert.

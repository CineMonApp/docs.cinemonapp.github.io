## Overview

CineMon for {{< mac >}} and CineMon for {{< ipad >}} share the exact same toolset and functionality. However, there are some minor UI differences to optimize the user experience for each platform.

For instance, the Mac supports a wider variety of monitor sizes and resolutions, more hardware accessories (such as the Blackmagic UltraStudio/Decklink line), and is very mouse centric. While the iPad UI is more optimized for touch.

However, iOS 26/macOS 26 (Tahoe) has minimized these differences. The iOS 26 version of CineMon supports keyboard shortcuts and a resizable window.

## Cross-Platform Compatibility

As mentioned in [CineMon {{< pro-pill >}} in-app purchases](/docs/#cinemon-pro-in-app-purchases), when you purchase a **CineMon Tool Bundle** or a **CineMon {{< pro-pill >}} *Pass***, you get access to those features in all your devices registered with the same Apple account.

You can freely export/import [Presets](/docs/presets), custom [False Color Gradients](/docs/tools/false-color), and LUTs between devices, to keep them all in sync. You can also share these with other CineMon users

## Fit For Purpose

By design, CineMon is highly flexible and supports many different use cases, with more features, higher quality, ease of use, at a fraction of the price of traditional hardware offerings. Ultimately, the device/platform and configuration you use will depend on how you use the app and what you use it for.

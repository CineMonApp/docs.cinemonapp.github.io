## 1  Overview / Purpose & Usage
The **Vectorscope** maps hue and saturation onto a polar graph: angle equals hue, distance equals saturation.  Enable it from the Scopes bar; a circular plot appears, complete with skin‑tone line at roughly 11 degrees.  Drag the scope or full‑screen it for colour‑critical work.

## 2  Options & Modes
| Option | Choices | Use Case |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Display | Mono, Colour | Mono for clean shape; Colour for teaching hue angles. |
| Targets | Boxes, Polar Grid, ×2 Markers | Guides for legal and oversaturated levels. |
| Extents | Toggle | Shows envelope of flashing colours. |
| Trace Brightness | 0 – 100 % | Visibility control. |

Enabling **Targets** reveals broadcast boxes (75 % sat), while **×2 Markers** double their radius, helping judge HDR grade overshoot.  **Extents** is invaluable under concert strobes: saturation spikes are drawn as a faint ghost beyond the steady trace, highlighting where neons risk gamut clipping.

## 3  Tips, Best Practices & Use‑Cases
Place a colour chart in frame; switch to **Colour** mode and twist the camera’s white‑balance until the grey chip sits on the centre dot—instant neutral.  To monitor skin, keep an eye on the 11 degree line: as long as the blob touches it, complexions look natural even with funky lighting.

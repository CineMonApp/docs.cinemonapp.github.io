## Overview

The Waveform Monitor is a flexible exposure measurement instrument that displays a two-dimensional histogram of the image. Each pixel column represents a *Luma* histogram of the corresponding input image pixel column, where the height of the pixel represents the luma value (0 at the bottom to 100 at the top) and the intensity represents the histogram value.

*Double-click/tap* in the window to open the Waveform Monitor settings bar. There are four types of Waveform displays: **Luma**, **Colorized**, **RGB**, and **Parade**. You can toggle the display of the signal's envelope extents and adjust the trace brightness, in addition to the size and display controls of the floating window.

Where the Histogram shows how *much* brightness exists, the **Waveform** shows *where* that brightness sits across the image width. Shadows anchor at the bottom of the graph, highlights at the top.

> If you're new to Waveform Monitors, try making it full screen and lowering the opacity of the floating window background to see the scope overlayed on the input image. This can help visualize the relationship between the original image and the scope trace.

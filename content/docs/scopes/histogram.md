## Overview

The Histogram scope shows the luminance distribution in the image. Three types of histogram displays are available in the non-PRO version of CineMon: **Luma**, **RGB**, and **Stacked**.

 *Double-click/tap* in the window to open the histogram settings bar. The **RGB** mode overlays semi-transparent **R**, **G**, and **B** channel traces while the **Stacked** mode displays them one on top of the other. You can adjust the trace's gain, move and resize the histogram window or make it full screen. You can also customize the color and opacity of the reticle and the opacity of the floating window background.

## Overview
The **Scopes** in CineMon give objective, instrument-grade feedback on exposure, colour balance, and signal legality—complementing the subjective judgement you make by eye.

| Scope | Primary Purpose |
|-------|-----------------|
| **Histogram** | Overall pixel distribution — spot clipping or crushed blacks fast. |
| **Waveform** | Horizontal luma (and RGB) profile — level horizons, match multi-cam. |
| **Vectorscope** | Hue & saturation — nail white-balance and keep skin on the line. |
| **Quad Scope View** | Fixed 2×2 grid showing Parade, Vectorscope, Waveform, Histogram at once. |

Each scope window is:

* **Draggable & Resizable** – position it where your eye naturally falls.
* **Double-tappable** – open settings or go full-screen for colour-critical work.
* **Preset-aware** – its mode, size, and brightness are stored per Configuration Preset.

Dive into the individual scope pages to master configuration options such as trace gain, channel parade modes, and broadcast-legal targets—and learn practical workflows like using the Waveform’s Instant Extents during strobe-heavy concert shoots.

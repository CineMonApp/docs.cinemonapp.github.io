## Overview

The **Scopes** in CineMon are calibrated digital instruments that provide objective feedback on exposure, colour balance, and signal legality, complementing the subjective judgement you make by eye.

## Available Scopes

If you purchased the CineMon {{< pro-pill >}} Video Monitoring Bundle or a CineMon {{< pro-pill >}} ***Pass*** subscription, you get access to the following scopes:

* [**Histogram**](/docs/scopes/histogram)
* [**Waveform Monitor**](/docs/scopes/waveform)
* [**Vectorscope**](/docs/scopes/vectorscope)

## Floating Scopes

You can assign any scope to a [Specialize Viewer](/docs/user-interface#specialized-viewers), and you can also open them as [Floating Windows](/docs/user-interface#floating-scopes) that hover above the main viewer. Floating scopes are:

* **Draggable & Resizable**
* **Double-tappable**
* **Preset-aware**

Dive into the following individual scope pages for additional information on configuration options such as trace gain, waveform modes, and broadcast-legal targets.

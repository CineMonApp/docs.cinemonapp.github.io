## 1  Overview / Purpose & Usage
Sometimes you need every scope at once.  The **Quad Scope View** arranges Waveform, Vectorscope, Histogram, and Parade into a 2 × 2 grid with one tap of the Quad icon.  The layout is fixed so your muscle memory knows exactly where to glance for luma vs chroma.

## 2  Options & Modes
Each individual scope retains its own settings—double‑tap the Histogram quadrant to switch from Luma to RGB; CineMon updates just that window.  Trace brightness and background alpha obey the values you last set in floating mode.

## 3  Tips, Best Practices & Use‑Cases
DIT carts often park an iPad in Quad mode and mirror it via Sidecar to a MacBook, giving clients the hero image while the DIT views scopes.  When switching back to floating scopes CineMon restores their last positions, so your customised waveform width isn’t lost.

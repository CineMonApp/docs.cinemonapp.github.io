## Overview

The **Organizer** tab in the **Sidebar** allows you to manage all application assets:

* **Presets**
* **LUTs**
* **False Color Gradients**.

## Asset Class Actions

The **Organizer** shows action button(s) next to the asset class name, at the top of the list that allow you to **Import** items of that class, or **Add** a new item (in the Presets category.)

## List Item Actions

You can *long-press* ({{< ipad >}}), *right-click* ({{< mac >}}) on any list item to reveal all available actions.

> *Swiping* (left or right) on a list item reveals shortcut buttons for the same actions.

| Action | Description | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Export** (Presets and Gradients Only) | Save the selected item to the file system. | The saved item can be backed up, copied to other devices, and even shared with other CineMon users. |
| **Save Changes** (Presets Only) | Save all configuration changes to the selected Preset. | Only if the `edited` badge is active. |
| **Revert Changes** (Presets Only) | Reverts any configuration changes to the last saved version of the selected Preset. | Only if the `edited` badge is active. |
| **Duplicate** (Presets and Gradients Only) | Creates a copy of the selected Preset with the same name + "(Copy)". |
| **Rename** | Enters rename mode to allow you to change the name of the selected item. | |
| **Delete** | Deletes the selected item. | Gradients marked with a `locked` badge are built-in Gradients and cannot be deleted. |



## List Item Reordering

{{< screenshot name="organizer-presets-reorder" alt="Organizer > Presets" >}}

You can reorder items by dragging them into position. The order in which they appear on the list will be reflected everywhere else on the app. For instance, the **Presets Menu** and *Swipe-to-cycle* Presets gesture will respect the configured order. Likewise for cycling through LUTs, and wherever False Color Gradients appear.

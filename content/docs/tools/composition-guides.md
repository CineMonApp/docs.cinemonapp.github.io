## Overview
The **Grid Guide** overlays a series of evenly-spaced horizontal and vertical lines over the image to assist with alignment and composition.

The tool's options allow you to adjust the number of horizontal and vertical lines, and the color and opacity of the grid.

Perhaps the most common setup is 2 horizontal and 2 vertical lines to create a **Rule of Thirds** layout. But you can tweak both axis indepenently up to 10 lines.

## Options

{{< option-bar-sprite row="12" >}}

| Option | Values | Default | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| Vertical Lines | `1`–`10` | `2` | Sets the number of equally‑spaced *vertical lines*. |
| Horizontal Lines | `1`–`10` | `2` | Sets the number of equally‑spaced *horizontal lines*. |
| Guide Color | Full color & alpha | White, 50% | Controls the color and opacity of the grid. |

> As with all other composition tools, the **Composition Guides** respect the aspect ratio of the input image and **Framing Guide A**, if enabled.

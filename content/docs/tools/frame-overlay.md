## 1  Overview / Purpose & Usage
Continuity breaks cost time.  CineMon’s **Frame Overlay** lets you capture a still frame—or load one from storage—and overlay it on top of the live feed so you can line up props, talent, or camera angle with pixel‑level precision.  Once the tool is enabled from the **Overlay** icon, you either hit the mini camera‑button to grab the current frame or browse Files for a reference image.  The overlay floats in place while the picture continues playing beneath.

## 2  Options & Modes
| Option | Value Type | Range / Choices | Detail |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|--------|
| Capture Still | Button | — | Grabs current frame into overlay memory. |
| Load Image | File browser | PNG / JPG / TIFF | Imports pre‑shot references. |
| Opacity | Percentage slider | **0 – 100 %** | Controls the transparency of the frame overlay. |
| Wipe | Dial | **0 – 180 °** | Reveals overlay via angular split plane. |
| Difference Mode | Toggle | Off / On | Shows pixel‑differences in user‑picked colour. |

The **Opacity** slider is perfect for set‑dressing: drag to 50 percent and move furniture until it blends with yesterday’s still.  **Wipe** rotates a razor‑sharp split; at 90 degrees it becomes a horizontal “before/after” bar you can slide by finger.  **Difference Mode** helps VFX teams: any pixel that changed lights up in red (or a colour you choose), instantly flagging mis‑aligned markers.

## 3  Tips, Best Practices & Use‑Cases
During multi‑day food shoots, crews capture a hero composition at the end of day one.  On day two, the overlay guides re‑plating so the salad leaves land exactly where the creative director approved them.  Difference Mode is brilliant for match‑moving miniature plates—any parallax drift shows up immediately, avoiding expensive post stabilising.

## 1  Overview / Purpose & Usage
CineMon’s **Spot Meter** places two draggable probes labelled “A” and “B” on the frame and reports their luma in Exposure Value units relative to middle grey.  Tap the **Spot** icon; two translucent circles appear.  Drag them over any pixel—values update in the corner HUD, along with a live A/B ratio that helps lighting techs balance key and fill.

## 2  Options & Modes
| Option | Value Type | Range / Choices | Use Case |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|----------|
| EV Display | Toggle | HUD On / Off | Hides numbers for client feed. |
| Ratio Display | Toggle | HUD On / Off | Shows difference between probes as a multiplier. |
| Probe Colour | RGBA swatch | Full palette | Tint of the probe outlines. |

Turning off **EV Display** leaves the rings but removes numbers—handy when the feed routes to big venue screens.  **Ratio Display** simplifies maths: if you want a 1:2 key‑to‑fill, drag B until the ratio reads **2.0 ×**; adjust fill light until satisfied.  Colouring the probes orange or teal makes them pop against both warm and cool scenes.

## 3  Tips, Best Practices & Use‑Cases
Lighting designers drop Probe A on talent’s key side cheekbone and Probe B on fill side; they dim or brighten the fill light until the ratio hits the look bible—often 1:3 for drama.  For product spots, place a probe on packaging highlights and drag the other over reflective surfaces; the EV delta instantly shows whether the print stays legible.

## 1  Overview / Purpose & Usage
The Center Mark is the simplest overlay in CineMon: a single cross‑hair (or bull‑seye, depending on the theme) anchored at exact mid‑frame.  Toggle it with the **Center** icon.  Because there is practically nothing to configure, the tool behaves like an *instant flashlight*—tap and there it is, right when the dolly grip asks, “Are we perfectly centred?”

## 2  Options & Modes
| Option | Value Type | Range | Function |
|--------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Mark Colour | RGBA swatch | Full palette | Hue of the cross‑hair / bull‑seye |

Although only colour is available, that tiny choice matters.  A saturated lime is legible on night exteriors, whereas a low‑alpha grey offers guidance without shouting on client monitors.  CineMon saves the exact RGBA value with the current preset, ensuring that your discreet centre point returns each time you reload “Steadicam Pass 2”.

## 3  Tips, Best Practices & Use‑Cases
Pair the Center Mark with **Safe Area** rectangles to guarantee motion‑graphics stay dead‑centre *and* within title‑safe boundaries.  VFX supervisors appreciate leaving the mark on while capturing clean plates—the dot makes 2‑D track solves trivial, and because it is generated digitally, you can remove it later by re‑exporting the plate without the overlay.

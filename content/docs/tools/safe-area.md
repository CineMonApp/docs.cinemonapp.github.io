## Overview

Broadcast engineers invented the **Safe Area** box to stop credits and supers from being chopped off on mismatched televisions. Today the concept survives in digital workflows.

You can configure the **Safe Area Guide** as a percentage of the main image size. This can be used to indicate a title safe or action safe area. You can also customize its color and opacity.

## Options

{{< option-bar-sprite row="14" >}}

| Option | Values | Default | Description |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Safe Area Percentage | `50%`-`100%` | `85%` | Scales the rectangle relative to the *current* aspect ratio. Common percentages are 90% for Action‑Safe and 80% for Title‑Safe. |
| Guide Color | Full color & alpha | White, 50% | Controls the color and opacity of the grid. |

> As with all other composition tools, the **Composition Guides** respect the aspect ratio of the input image and **Framing Guide A**, if enabled.

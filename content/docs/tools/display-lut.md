## Overview

Use this tool to apply a view LUT (Look Up Table) to the image. You can import, rename, and reorder an unlimited number of LUTs in CineMon (see [Organizer](/docs/organizer) for more details). This tool is often used to transform an image from a camera log color space (scene referred) to a display color space (display referred) for preview (see [Color Management](/docs/color-management) for more details).

In some sets a **Show LUT** is used to apply a custom look to the camera image that approximates the color grading that was developed by a colorist for post production.

## Overview

CineMon’s **Video Monitoring Tools** are real-time overlays and image-processing algorithms that help you compose, design, light, color, expose, and analyze any video signal.

They fall into three broad groups:

1. **Composition Aids** – Grid Overlay, Center Mark, Safe Area, Aspect Ratio Guides, Image Flip, Anamorphic De-squeeze
2. **Reference** – Frame Overlay, Color-Key Assist, Focus Assist
3. **Image/Exposure Helpers** – Zebras, Image Adjust, Display LUT, False Color, Spot Meter

Every tool can be toggled via the **Video Assist Toolbar** or a keyboard shortcut, adjusted in a slide-out options drawer, and saved into a Configuration Preset.

Explore each page in this section to learn more about each tool, **how** to configure its options, and **why** certain settings matter in different shooting scenarios.

> **Note:** All tools can be toggled and configured independently, and can be active concurrently. Although having multiple tools active at once can be useful, some combinations can result in a cluttered display. Experience will inform the best way to combine them for different use cases.

## Tool Option Drawers

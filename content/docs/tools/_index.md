## Overview
CineMon’s **Tools** are real-time overlays and image-processing helpers that sit directly on top of your camera feed.
They fall into three broad groups:

1. **Composition Aids** – Grid Overlay, Center Mark, Safe Area, Aspect Ratio Guides, Image Flip, Anamorphic De-squeeze
2. **Reference & Exposure Helpers** – Frame Overlay, Chroma-Key Assist, Focus Peaking, Zebras, Image Adjust, Display LUT, False Color, Spot Meter
3. **Utility Panels** – Presets Organizer, Settings Sidebar, Gestures & Shortcuts

Every tool can be toggled on-the-fly via the Video-Assist toolbar, adjusted in a slide-out drawer, and saved into a Configuration Preset.
Explore each page in this section to learn exactly **when** you’d enable a tool, **how** to configure its options, and **why** certain settings matter in different shooting scenarios.

> **Tip:** Tools are rendered in display order—LUTs → Image Adjust → Overlays—so downstream helpers like Zebras and False Color always analyse the grade you’re actually seeing.

## Overview
A technical layout prioritising scopes for exposure and colour control across multi‑cam shoots.

## Options
| Component | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Layout | 2×2 | Top‑Left: Waveform (RGB Parade). Top‑Right: Vectorscope. Bottom‑Left: Histogram. Bottom‑Right: Viewer. |
| CST | Log→709/P3 | Accurate instrument response across cameras. |
| False Color | Pre‑LUT | Technical exposure checks independent of look. |

## Tips & Use Cases
Use **Luma Range = Mid** on Vectorscope to isolate faces. Keep **Instant Extents** on Waveform during strobe/live shows.

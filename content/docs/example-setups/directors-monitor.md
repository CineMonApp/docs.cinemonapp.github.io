---

## Overview
A clean, confidence‑boosting view for directors and clients with minimal overlays, stable scopes on a secondary screen, and quick preset switching for aspect previews.

## Options
| Component | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Layout | 2×1 | Left = Viewer (clean), Right = Quad Scopes on Sidecar iPad. |
| Tools | Aspect Guides (low opacity) | Subtle composition hint without clutter. |
| LUTs | Tech + Show Look | Show Look in Slot 2; Bypass toggle for teaching moments. |

## Tips & Use Cases
Save *Client Clean* and *Client with Guides* presets and swipe between them. Keep scopes on a second display to avoid distracting the main view.

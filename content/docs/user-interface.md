description: A visual tour of CineMon‚Äôs main window
---

CineMon‚Äôs UI is purposely minimalistic and designed to let the image take center stage. Yet every tool and monitoring function lives no more than a single tap/click/key-press away. The interface can also be customized to adapt to personal preferences, workflows, and use cases.

{{< screenshot name="help" alt="Help Screen" >}}

CineMon's main window is divided into three main areas: the [**Top Toolbar**](#toolbars), the [**Main Display Area**](#main-display-area), and the [**Bottom Toolbar**](#toolbars). Each area is composed of one or more regions that group related functions.

On first run, or whenever there is no active video source, the **Main Display Area** shows the [**Home Screen**](#home-screen).

> From the app's **Main Display Area**, you can show a general UI overview by *tapping/clicking* the question mark (**?**) button on the right side (only visible when no source is active). With the Help overlay active, *Tap/Click* the information (**i**) button for each region to reveal additional details.

When a video source is active, the **Main Display Area** shows one or more [**Image Viewers**](#image-viewer) depending on the active [**Layout**](#layout-system).

You can *double-tap/-click* on any viewer to hide the toolbars. The **Main Display Area** will expand to cover the whole window. *Double-tap/click* again to bring the toolbars back.

This section walks you through each area and region of the interface in detail.

## Main Display Area

### Home Screen

{{< screenshot name="main-pro" alt="Main Display Area" >}}

Whenever there is no active video source, the **Main Display Area** shows the **Home Screen**, which contains a [**Sources Panel**](#sources-panel) and a link to the **CineMon** Store. To the right of the **Sources Panel** you'll find a help button (?). On {{< ipad >}}, you will also find a button to open the [**App Settings**](/docs/app-settings).

#### Sources Panel

The **Sources Panel** shows all available input sources. The left column lists all live input sources. The right column lists all recently opened files and a button to open a new file for playback.

To start monitoring a source, click on its corresponding power button **‚èª** or on the source name. The **Home Screen** will be replaced by a [**Viewer**](#viewer) for the active source.

### Viewer

{{< screenshot name="media-main" alt="Image Viewer" >}}

By default, CineMon displays a single image viewer that renders all video assist overlays and effects directly on the source image.

#### Zoom Control

You can magnify the image by using a *pinch-to-zoom* gesture on the image itself, or by using the **Zoom Control** (üîç) on the **Video Assist Toolbar**.

When zoomed in, a mini-map appears and a red rectangle indicates the portion of the image that is currently visible in the viewer. You can navigate to other areas of the image by dragging the image itself, or by dragging the red rectangle in the mini-map. Zoom all the way out to turn off the mini-map.

{{< screenshot name="zoom" alt="Zoom" >}}

#### Specialized Viewers

CineMon also includes other types of specialized viewers with specific monitoring functions. To change the active viewer type {{< ipad >}} Long Press {{< mac >}} Right-click on the viewer to bring up a context menu with all available viewers.

### Layout System

The **Main Display Area** displays a single viewer by default, but CineMon {{< pro-pill >}} supports multi-view layouts, which can host multiple viewers simultaneously, in different **Panels**. To change the display layout, use the **Display Layout** menu on the **Status Toolbar**.

{{< screenshot name="layout-menu" alt="Layout Menu" >}}

| **Layout** | **Displays** |
|------------|--------------|
| Single View (Default) | One viewer at a time. |
| 1x2 Grid | Two viewers, arranged one over the other, vertically (a.k.a. top-bottom). |
| 2x1 Grid | Two viewers, arranged side by side, horizontally (a.k.a. side-by-side). |
| 2x2 Grid | Four Viewers, arranged in a grid with two columns and two rows. |

The size of the panels in multi-view layouts can be changed by *dragging* the divider between the panels.

#### 2x1 Grid

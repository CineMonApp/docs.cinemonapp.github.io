## 1  Overview / Purpose & Usage
CineMon for Mac translates the exact same toolset to desktop, perfect for Video Village or colourist dailies.  Plug a Blackmagic UltraStudio into Thunderbolt, launch CineMon, and the capture feed appears in a resizable window whose chrome mirrors the iPad layout.  Keyboard shortcuts double the gesture set so editors feel at home.

## 2  Options & Modes
| Mac‑Specific Feature | Details |
|----------------------|---------|
| Window Resizing | Scopes and overlays scale; full‑screen available on a second monitor. |
| Menu Bar | Every tool lives under the Window menu for quick access. |
| Drag & Drop | Import LUTs, gradients, presets by dropping files onto the window. |

Because macOS allows multiple windows, you can duplicate CineMon and place scopes on one display, picture on another—all synced to the same audio‑locked capture stream.

## 3  Tips, Best Practices & Use‑Cases
Pair a Mac Mini with an HDR OLED, run CineMon full‑screen, and you have a professional review station for under \$1 k.  Enable **Quad Scope View** on an iPad via Sidecar while the Mac shows only picture; the colourist can eyeball both at once without clutter.
